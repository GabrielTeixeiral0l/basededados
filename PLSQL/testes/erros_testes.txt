SQL Error: ORA-01722: invalid number

https://docs.oracle.com/error-help/db/ora-01722/01722. 00000 -  "unable to convert string value containing %s to a number: %s"
*Document: YES
*Cause:    The attempted conversion of a character string for column or
           expression to a number failed because the character string is not
           a valid numeric literal. Only numeric fields or character fields
           containing numeric data can be used in arithmetic functions or
           expressions. Only numeric fields can be added to or subtracted from
           dates. If "UNISTR" appears in the error message, the value is
           not compatible with the national character set and cannot be
           represented directly.
*Action:   Use the LIKE expression to identify the problematic value. Ensure
           that it contains only digits, a sign, a decimal separator, and
           the character "E" or "e", and retry the operation.
*Params:   1) invalid_char
           the character string that is being converted to a number or
           UNISTR (character string) if the character is not compatible
           with the database character set.
           2) column_or_expression: The column or expression from where the
           invalid character comes.
